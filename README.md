# Py-CityWeather

## A Simple Command-Line Utility developed in Python

This repository hosts a foundational Python application designed for instant weather data retrieval. Operating as a command-line utility, it processes user input of a city name and utilizes external API integration to accurately display current weather conditions. This initial release prioritizes core functionality and serves as the basic structure for future enhancements, including feature expansions such as multi-day forecasts, persistent data storage, and the development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
